This tutorial shows how to transfer file of any size using winsock control.

open vb
select standard exe

press cntrl+t to show the add component window

select winsock control and microsoft common dialog

add one winsock control in the project--name it winsock1

if you want to add chat then add another winsock and name it winsock2

insert another winsock object if you want to add chat also

add a microsoft common dialog box --- name it cd

we will use this winsock1 object to transfer the file and winsock2 for chat



The basic idea :
To send a file of any size to any ip using winsock first we have to open the file in binary mode.
then get chunks of data from it, chunk is a constant which is initialized to 8000, so we get 8000
bytes of data each time and send it using winsock to the client.
for example let "fname" be the string variable containg the file name then :



Private Const chunk = 8000

dim fname as string  'get the name of the file
 

Open fname For Binary As #1
Do While Not EOF(1)
data = Input(chunk, #1)
winsock1,sendata data
DoEvents
loop




this will send 8000bytes of data from the file until the file ends.


but before sending data from file to client we must send info about the file 
like..the name of the file...the extension...etc

so when send is clicked first check wether a file is there i mean check wether something
is typed in the text box and if yes check wether the file exists

if both the above conditions are met then get the filename with the extension.
send the file name to the client with "rqst" in front.
for eg. if the name of file is "text.txt" then send "rqsttext.txt" to the client

the client will then get the file name and display a msgbox with the name of the
file and the user will be given a choice wether to accept the file or not
if he\she selects yes then the client sends "okay" to the server and if he\she selects 
no then it sends "deny" to the server..this data i.e. "okay" or '"deny" arrivers on winsock1's
local port the data is then checked using select case if its okay then "send" function
is called with file address as an argument and send button and all buttons and text boxes
associated with send file are disabled.
If the response from client is "deny" then a msgbox is shown on server saying that the
request to send the file .... as been denied..the user can send another request..or 
ask the client's user to accept the file using the chat module...



this is called when send is clicked
private sub send_click()

'GET FILE NAME
'using getfilename function to get the file name
dim fnamea as string
dim fname as string

if text1.text = "" then
msgbox "Please type the file name!!!", ,"Manjit"
exit sub
end if
fname = text1.text
'checking wether the file exists
If Dir(fname) = "" Then
MsgBox "File Does not exist Exists", ,"manjit"
exit sub 'exiting sub it file does not exists
end if

fnamea=GetFileName(text1.text)
fname=text2.text
dim temp as string
temp= "rqst" & fnamea

'SEND

winsock1.senddata  temp 'sending file name of file

end sub 

now the request is sent to the client
then the server has to wait for the client's response

this event is called when data arrives on winsock1

Private Sub winsock1_dataarrival(ByVal bytestotal As Long)
Dim response As String
Winsock1.GetData response, vbString
Select Case response
Case "okay"
send fname 'send function is called with file name as argument
Case "deny"
MsgBox "Your request to send the file " & fname & " has been denied", , "manjit" 'message when request is denied
End Select
End Sub

The send function which actally sends the file


Private Sub send(fname As String)
Command2.Enabled = False
Command3.Enabled = False
Text1.Enabled = False

Dim data As String
Dim a As Long
Dim data1 As String
Dim data2 As String


Open fname For Binary As #1

Do While Not EOF(1)
data = Input(chunk, #1)
Winsock1.SendData data
DoEvents
Loop

Winsock1.SendData "EnDf"
Close #1
Command2.Enabled = True
Command3.Enabled = True
Text1.Enabled = True

End Sub


'Other supporting functions: 

Function GetFileName(attach_str As String) As String
    Dim s As Integer
    Dim temp As String
    s = InStr(1, attach_str, "\")
    temp = attach_str
    Do While s > 0
        temp = Mid(temp, s + 1, Len(temp))
        s = InStr(1, temp, "\")
    Loop
    GetFileName = temp
End Function



On the client side : 

set winsock1 to listen to a particular port say : 165
and winsoc2 if you want chat too :166


winsock1 is listening to port 165 and winsock2 is listening to port 166
on the client side


so when connection request arrives :

private sub winsock1_connectionrequest(byval idrequest as long)
if winsock1.state <> sckConnected then
winsock1.close
winsock1.accept idrequest
end if
end sub

and:

private sub winsock2_connectionrequest(byval idrequest as long)
if winsock2.state <> sckConnected then
winsock2.close
winsock2.accept idrequest
end if
end sub

DATA ARRIVAL:

and when data arrives




Private Sub winsock1_dataarrival(ByVal bytestotal As Long)

Dim data As String
Dim data4 As String
Dim data2 As String
Dim data3 As String
Dim data5 As String
Dim data6 As String

Winsock1.GetData data, vbString

data2 = Left(data, 4)
Select Case data2
Case "rqst"  'file request arrives

data3 = Right(data, Len(data) - (4)) 'Get the file name

Dim msg1 As Integer  'Stores user's selection
msg1 = MsgBox(Winsock1.RemoteHost & " wants to send you file " & data3 & " accept ? ", vbYesNo, "Manjit")  'msgbox displayed


If msg1 = 6 Then  'if user selects yes
Winsock1.SendData "okay"
cd.FileName = data3
data5 = Split(data3, ".")(1)
data6 = "*." & data5
cd.DefaultExt = "(data6)"
data4 = App.Path & "\" & data3
'MsgBox data5
'cd.ShowSave

Open data4 For Binary As #1

Else
Winsock1.SendData "deny"
Exit Sub
End If

Case "EnDf"
Label1.Caption = "File revieved.Size of file : " & sz & " Kb"
size=0
sz=o
Close #1
Case Else

size = size + 1
Label1.Caption = size * 8 & "Kb Recieved"
sz = size * 8
Put #1, , data
End Select
End Sub

This will take care of file transfer now for the chat:
we will be using winsock2 for chat:

On server side :

WHEN SEND IS CLICKED

Private Sub Command1_Click()
Dim chat As String
chat = Text1.Text
List1.AddItem (chat)
Winsock2.SendData chat

End Sub

when data arrives :

Private Sub winsock2_dataarrival(ByVal bytestotal As Long)
Dim cht As String
Winsock2.GetData cht, vbString
List1.AddItem (cht)

End Sub


the same will be on the client side also...if you want a better chat client then visit
